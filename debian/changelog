  [ Krzysztof Klimonda ]
  * New upstream release (LP: #512391)
  * Fixes bugs:
    - transmission consistently reports having downloading 115-130% of the
      required data with no corresponding corrupt download data numbers
      (LP: #499964)
  * debian/patches/99_autoreconf.patch:
    - Refreshed for the new changes

  [ Chris Coulson ]

      code the library name in transmission_LDADD

      it from breaking with an autoconf run (LP: #510776)
